```{r, echo=TRUE, results="hide", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(phyloseq)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(MicrobiomeAnalysis)
```


## Importing Data

+ Converting the output of dada2 into phyloseq object

```{r}
seq_tab <- readRDS(
  system.file("extdata", "dada2_seqtab.rds",
              package = "MicrobiomeAnalysis"))
tax_tab <- readRDS(
  system.file("extdata", "dada2_taxtab.rds",
              package = "MicrobiomeAnalysis"))
sam_tab <- read.table(
  system.file("extdata", "dada2_samdata.txt",
              package = "MicrobiomeAnalysis"),
  sep = "\t", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)

ps_dada2 <- import_dada2(
   seq_tab = seq_tab,
   tax_tab = tax_tab,
   sam_tab = sam_tab)

ps_dada2
```

+ Converting the qiime2 output of dada2 into phyloseq object
```{r}
otuqza_file <- system.file(
    "extdata", "table.qza",
    package = "MicrobiomeAnalysis")
taxaqza_file <- system.file(

    otu_qza = otuqza_file, taxa_qza = taxaqza_file,
    sam_tab = sample_file, tree_qza = treeqza_file
)

ps_qiime2
```


+ Convertings inputs into SummarizedExperiment object
```{r}
data("Zeybel_2022_protein")
assay <- SummarizedExperiment::assay(Zeybel_2022_protein) %>%
  data.frame()
rowData <- SummarizedExperiment::rowData(Zeybel_2022_protein) %>%
  data.frame()
colData <- SummarizedExperiment::colData(Zeybel_2022_protein) %>%
  data.frame()
metadata <- list(lab="hua", type="protein")

assay <- assay[1:10, 1:10]

se_protein <- import_SE(
    object = assay,
    rowdata = rowData,
    coldata = colData,
    metadata = metadata)

```


## Extracting specific levels

+ Extracting "Genus" levels phyloseq object 
```{r}
ps_genus <- aggregate_taxa(x = ps_dada2, 
                           level = "Genus")
ps_genus
```


## Summarizing specific levels 

+ Phyloseq object contains from Kingdom to the the specific taxonomic levels (Phylum)
```{r}
ps_summarize_genus <- summarize_taxa(
    ps = ps_dada2, 
    level = "Genus")
ps_summarize_genus
```

## Data Transformation

5 methods to transform individual values (**by individual value**).

+ "log10", the transformation is log10(object), and if the data contains zeros the transformation is log10(1 + object).

+ "log10p", the transformation is log10(1 + object).

+ "SquareRoot", the transformation is Square Root.

+ "CubicRoot", the transformation is Cubic Root.

+ "logit", the transformation is  Zero-inflated Logit Transformation (Does not work well for microbiome data).


Here is for `phyloseq-class`.
```{r}
data("Zeybel_2022_gut")
ps_transform <- transform_abundances(
  object = Zeybel_2022_gut,
  level = "Phylum",
  transform = "log10p")

head(ps_transform@otu_table@.Data[, 1:5], 3)
```


+ Here is for `SummarizedExperiment-class`.
```{r}
data("Zeybel_2022_protein")
se_transform <- transform_abundances(
  object = Zeybel_2022_protein,
  transform = "SquareRoot")

head(assay(se_transform)[, 1:5], 3)
```


## Data Imputation

11 methods to impute missing value (NAs or Zeros)

+ "LOD": specific Limit Of Detection which provides by user.

+ "half_min": half minimal values across samples except zero.

+ "median": median values across samples except zero.

+ "mean": mean values across samples except zero.

+ "min": minimal values across samples except zero.

+ "knn": k-nearest neighbors samples.

+ "rf": nonparametric missing value imputation using Random Forest.

+ "global_mean": a normal distribution with a mean that is down-shifted from the sample mean and a standard deviation that is a fraction of the standard deviation of the sample distribution.

+ "svd": missing values imputation based Singular value decomposition.

+ "QRILC": missing values imputation based quantile regression. (default: "none").


`phyloseq-class` as inputs
```{r}
data("Zeybel_2022_gut")
ps_impute <- impute_abundance(
  object = Zeybel_2022_gut,
  level = "Phylum",
  group = "LiverFatClass",
  ZerosAsNA = TRUE,
  RemoveNA = TRUE,
  cutoff = 20,
  method = "knn")

head(ps_impute@otu_table@.Data[, 1:5], 3)
```

+ Inputs is from `SummarizedExperiment-class`.
```{r}
data("Zeybel_2022_protein")
se_impute <- impute_abundance(
  object = Zeybel_2022_protein,
  group = "LiverFatClass",
  ZerosAsNA = TRUE,
  RemoveNA = TRUE,
  cutoff = 20,
  method = "knn")

head(assay(se_impute)[, 1:5], 3)
```


## Data Normalization

Normalizing the OTU_table in phyloseq-class object sample by sample to reduce the effects of systematic differences such as library size (**by sample**).

+ "rarefy": random subsampling counts to the smallest library size in the data set.

+ "TSS": total sum scaling, also referred to as "relative abundance", the abundances were normalized by dividing the corresponding sample library size.

+ "TMM": trimmed mean of m-values. First, a sample is chosen as reference. The scaling factor is then derived using a weighted trimmed mean over the differences of the log-transformed gene-count fold-change between the sample and the reference.

+ "RLE", relative log expression, RLE uses a pseudo-reference calculated using the geometric mean of the gene-specific abundances over all samples. The scaling factors are then calculated as the median of the gene counts ratios between the samples and the reference.

+ "CSS": cumulative sum scaling, calculates scaling factors as the cumulative sum of gene abundances up to a data-derived threshold.

+ "CLR": centered log-ratio normalization.

+ "CPM": pre-sample normalization of the sum of the values to 1e+06.

```{r}
data("caporaso")
ps_norm <- normalize(
    object = caporaso,
    method = "TSS")

head(ps_norm@otu_table@.Data[, 1:5], 3)
```



## Data Scaling

Data scaling adjusts each variable/feature by a scaling factor computed based on the dispersion of the variable (**by variable/feature**).

+ "mean_center": values minus mean statistic.

+ "zscore": mean-centered and divided by the standard deviation of each variable.

+ "pareto": mean-centered and divided by the square root of the standard deviation of each variable.

+ "range": mean-centered and divided by the range of each variable. (default: "none").

## Data Trimming

Trimming samples or features whose prevalence is less than threshold

## Data Filtering

+ Feature is more than Mean relative abundance across all samples;

+ Feature is more than Minimum relative abundance at least one sample.
